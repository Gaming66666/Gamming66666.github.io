### 1. Research and Analysis of Vegetable Pricing Strategy Model Based on Single Objective Optimization Algorithm

- **Authors:** Mingjia Liu, Jiaxing Yang, Zelong Huang
- **Affiliation:** Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
- **Abstract:** This paper explores the periodicity of sales volume for different categories of vegetables using wavelet analysis and analyzes the differences between different categories through t-tests. An exponential relationship between sales volume and selling price/cost price is revealed, and a single-objective optimization model is established to maximize profits.

### 3. Modeling Solar Cycle Onset and Duration Based on Sunspot Activity Trends

- **Authors:** Kechen Li, Jiaming Liu, Zhenyu Wu
- **Abstract:** This article develops LSTM and combined prediction models based on the number of sunspots and solar area to forecast the activity of the 25th and 26th solar cycles. The models are evaluated for reliability using MSE.
